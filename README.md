#Development of protein disorder prediction server using Machine Learning and Django
##Aims:
This project focuses on one particularly structural aspect of proteins called intrinsic disorder where proteins don't form the stable 'native fold' that give the protein its function and instead perform other functions instead, in some cases implicating them in certain diseases. The DisProt database has information about protein disorder where the proteins are categorised by their ontology and this project aims to make use of this data. Delving further into this subject area through this project aims to:
* Learn about disordered protein ontology and its behaviour based on varying environmental effects (e.g. differences in pH or organelles)
* Determine whether disordered region prediction can be aided by factoring the environmental effects into the machine learning models
